I am a Distinguished Research Scientist at [Meta AI](http://research.facebook.com/ai). My research focuses on artificial intelligence. Before, I worked as an Assistant Professor (with tenure) at [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl), as a post-doctoral researcher at [UC San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu), and as a Ph.D. student at [Tilburg University](http://www.tilburguniversity.edu).

I am interested in a variety of topics in artificial intelligence. In particular, I am interested in embedding models, large-scale weakly supervised learning, visual reasoning, cost-sensitive learning, language modeling, and applications in the arts and sciences.
