I am an Research Scientist at [Facebook AI Research](http://research.facebook.com/ai) in New York, working on machine learning and computer vision. Before, I worked as an Assistant Professor at [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl), as a post-doctoral researcher at [UC San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu), and as a Ph.D. student at [Tilburg University](http://www.tilburguniversity.edu).

I am interested in a variety of topics in machine learning and computer vision. Currently, I am working on learning embeddings for visualization and deep learning, time series classification, regularization, object tracking, and cost-sensitive learning.
