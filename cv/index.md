I am a Distinguisged Research Scientist at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/), working on the next generation of foundational generative AI models (Llama). Prior, I led a team of 130+ Meta AI researchers who developed technology to solve grand challenges in the natural sciences. My team delivered research breakthroughs including [Cicero](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097), [ESM-2 and ESMFold](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade2574), [Llama](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971), and [OC22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08917). Before joining Meta, I worked as an Assistant Professor (with tenure) at [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl), and as a post-doctoral researcher under supervision of [Lawrence Saul](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~saul/) at [University of California, San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu). I received my Ph.D. from [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu) in 2009 under the supervision of [Eric Postma](http://www.ericpostma.nl) and [Jaap van den Herik](http://www.law.leidenuniv.nl/org/metajuridica/elaw/medewerkers/jaapvandenherik.html). I have visited the labs of [Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) at [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca), and of [Maja Pantic](http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/maja/) at [Imperial College London](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk). I obtained an M.Sc. degree in computer science from [Maastricht University](http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl) in 2005.

## Research

My main research interests are in machine learning and computer vision. In particular, I am interested in embedding models, large-scale weakly supervised learning, visual reasoning, cost-sensitive learning, language modeling, and applications in the arts and sciences.

## Press and Awards

My work on web-scale weakly supervised learning was featured in Meta CTO [Mike Schroepfer]()'s [keynote at F8 2018](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/f8-2018/f8-2018-day-2-keynote/) (at 14:27). The work also received extensive press coverage in, among others, [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/your-instagram-dogs-and-cats-are-training-facebooks-ai/), [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/02/facebook-is-using-instagram-photos-and-hashtags-to-improve-its-computer-vision/), [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/2/17311808/facebook-instagram-ai-training-hashtag-images), and [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-advances-computer-vision-using-hashtagged-pictures/).

Our [DenseNet paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06993v2.pdf) received the [CVPR 2017 Best Paper Award](http://cvpr2017.thecvf.com/program/main_conference#cvpr2017_awards). The [Fisher information loss paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11673.pdf) received the [UAI 2021 Best Paper Award](https://twitter.com/david_sontag/status/1420924101393321984). Prior, I received the [SNN Machine Learning Award 2012](http://www.mlplatform.nl) and won the [Merck Visualization Challenge](http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/11/02/t-distributed-stochastic-neighbor-embedding-wins-merck-viz-challenge/) on [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com).
